# Introduction to Web Scraping

Short course taught at CEMFI's Undergraduate Summer Internship (2021)

### Outline
1. Intro to jupyter notebook and python
2. Web scraping example 1
3. Web scraping example 2


**Notes:** 
- Tripadvisor has changed its code so the tutorial 2 fails to run ("requests" does not work anymore).
- To explore the "requests" try this tutorial with another website of your choice.
- Alternatively, scrape Tripadvisor with the method from tutotial 3 (selenium).
